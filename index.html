      <h3 align="center">2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup</h3>
      <br>
        The ICC Men's <b>T20 World Cup</b> in 2022 will be the eighth edition in the series. It will be held in <b>Australia</b> from <b>October 16 to November 13</b>, 2022. Originally scheduled to take place in 2020, the <b>International Cricket Council (ICC)</b> declared in July 2020 that the event has been postponed owing to the <b>COVID-19 epidemic</b>. The ICC also stated in August 2020 that Australia will host the revised event in 2022, with the T20 World Cup initially set to take place in India in 2021 but then shifted to the UAE and Oman. The ICC confirmed all of the tournament's matches on <b>January 21, 2022</b>. Hosts <b>Australia</b> is also the <b>reigning world champion</b>.</p><br>
      <h4>Background</h4><br>
      <p>In April 2018, the ICC announced that the tournament would replace the scheduled <b>2021 ICC Champions Trophy.</b> This was after the ICC granted full international status to Twenty20 matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards.

        In October 2019, it was reported that the ICC could scrap the T20 World Cup Qualifier, which would have been used as a pathway for qualification to the T20 World Cup.[15] Therefore, twelve teams from the <b>2020 ICC T20 World Cup </b> and four teams from qualification events would advance to the T20 World Cup. On 23 January 2020, the ICC confirmed the full details of qualification for the tournament.[16] In May 2020, the ICC told the <b>Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)</b> that they reserve the rights to take away hosting rights from India, after the BCCI did not secure a tax exemption from the Indian government for the tournament.[17]
        
        In July 2020, when the <b> previous edition </b> of the tournament was being reviewed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Earl Eddings, the chairman of Cricket Australia suggested that Australia could host that tournament in October 2021, and India stage this tournament a year later in 2022.[18] The ICC also confirmed that either Australia or India, the hosts for the tournaments originally scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 respectively, would host this tournament.[19][20]</p>

      <h4>Teams and qualifications</h4><br>
      <p>The twelve teams that reached the <b>Super 12</b>  phase of the <b> 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup</b>  automatically qualified for the 2022 tournament. <b>Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa </b>all qualified directly for the Super 12 phase of this tournament, based on their performances in the 2021 tournament and their <b>rankings</b> as of 15 November 2021. <b>Namibia, Scotland, Sri Lanka and the West Indies</b> were all placed in the group stage of the competition.

        The remaining four places came from the top two teams from each of the two Global Qualifiers.The Global Qualifiers had a total of sixteen teams; the bottom four teams from the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup (<b>Ireland, Netherlands, Oman and Papua New Guinea</b>), the next four highest ranked T20I sides (<b>Zimbabwe, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore</b>), and the eight teams that progressed from the Regional Finals. From the Global Qualifier A tournament, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates progressed to the T20 World Cup. The UAE won the <b>Global Qualifier</b> A to be placed in Group A of the T20 World Cup, with Ireland placed in Group B. From the Global Qualifier B tournament, the Netherlands and Zimbabwe became the final two teams to qualify for the T20 World Cup. Zimbabwe won the Global Qualifier B tournament to be placed in Group B of the T20 World Cup, with the Netherlands being placed in Group A.</p>

      <h4>Venues</h4><br>
        <p>On 15 November 2021, the ICC confirmed the venues that will host matches across the tournament. The host cities are <b>Adelaide, Brisbane, Geelong, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney</b>.The semi-finals would take place at the <b>Sydney Cricket Ground and the Adelaide Oval</b>, with the final taking place at the <b>Melbourne Cricket Ground</b>.</p>
